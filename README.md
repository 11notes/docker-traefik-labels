# üèîÔ∏è Alpine - Traefik Labels
![size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/11notes/traefik-labels/latest?color=0eb305) ![version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/11notes/traefik-labels/latest?color=eb7a09) ![pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/11notes/traefik-labels?color=2b75d6)

**Export Traefik labels from any Docker node to a central location**

# SYNOPSIS
What can I do with this? This image will connect to all your Docker nodes and read their labels. It will then use the labels to update your Traefik configuration in Redis automatically and dynamically on each container start, stop or timeout. It also supports updating your internal and external DNS servers too, so you can use labels for everything. If a container is removed the image will automatically reverse any `nsupdate update add` to `nsupdate update delete` so entries are removed too.

In order to use this image, you need to setup Traefik with a Redis provider and then point this image via redis.url to the same Redis instance. Each entry will have an expire timer set in Redis, so that if a container is removed by a server crashing, Redis will automatically remove stale entries as well. Entries are refreshed every 300 seconds or on all docker container events (create, run, kill, stop, restart, ...). As for nsupdate, you need to setup tsig authentication in your NS servers and add the keys to the zones you want to be able to update, you can restrict the keys by using update-policy if you use Bind from ISC.

This image provides the ability to call a webhook for each container for each event or poll after the data was updates in Redis and or nsupdate.

Each node gets its own worker thread for better scalability. If you have 10 nodes, you will have 10 worker processes inside the container forked from the main process. Forks die when their node disconnects and use the `ping.interval` to fork new processes indefinitely. As soon as the node is back online, it will always execute a poll on all containers of that node.

## container on a node with Traefik routes
```shell
docker run --name traefik-demo \
  -p 8080:8080 \

# TIPS
* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx to terminate TLS with a valid certificate
* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates to protect your SSL endpoints

# DISCLAIMERS
* <sup>1</sup> For TLS to work you need proper certificates in place for your dockerd and your clients. The CN in the certificate needs to match the FQDN or IP you have set on the docker node, you can set multiple by using SAN. See an example of a daemon.json configuration to enable TLS.
```json
{
  "tls": true,
  "tlsverify": true,
  "tlscacert": "/etc/docker/ca.crt",
  "tlscert": "/etc/docker/server.crt",
  "tlskey": "/etc/docker/server.key",
  "hosts": ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2376"]
}
