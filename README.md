Run Traefik Labels based on Alpine Linux. Small, lightweight, secure and fast üèîÔ∏è

What can I do with this? Simply put: It will export any traefik labels on a container on the same host as this image runs to a Redis instance. This makes it possible for a centralized Traefik load balancer to update endpoints dynamically by utilizing the docker labels, just like you would on a local installation of Traefik with labels. It is meant as an alternative and simple way to proxy requests from a Traefik load balanacer to multiple docker nodes running in different networks and locations.

In order to use this image, you need to setup Traefik with a Redis provider and then point this image via REDIS_URL to the same Redis instance. Each entry will have an expire timer set in Redis, so that if a container is removed by a server crashing, Redis will automatically remove stale entries as well. Entries are refreshed every 60 seconds or on all docker container events (create, run, kill, stop, restart, ...).

This image provides the ability to call a webhook for each container for each event or poll after the data was updates in Redis.

## Run
```shell
docker run --name traefik-labels \
  -v /run/docker.sock:/run/docker.sock \
  -e LABELS_REDIS_URL="rediss://foo:bar@10.127.198.254:6379/0" \
  -d 11notes/traefik-labels:[tag]
```

```shell
docker run --name traefik-labels \
  -v /run/docker.sock:/run/docker.sock \
  -e LABELS_REDIS_URL="rediss://foo:bar@10.127.198.254:6379/0" \
  -e LABELS_WEBHOOK="https://domain.com/traefik/labels" \
  -e LABELS_WEBHOOK_AUTH_BASIC="foo:bar" \
  -d 11notes/traefik-labels:[tag]
```

This is a demo webserver that will start on :8080, all the traefik labels will be exportet to the Redis instance. They follow the exact same [syntax](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kv/) as for normal Redis and Traefik, just as labels.
```shell
docker run --name demo \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -l "traefik/http/routers/demo.domain.com/service=demo.domain.com" \
  -l "traefik/http/routers/demo.domain.com/rule=Host(`demo.domain.com`)" \
  -l "traefik/http/routers/demo.domain.com/tls=true" \
  -l "traefik/http/routers/demo.domain.com/entrypoints=https" \
  -l "traefik/http/services/demo.domain.com/loadbalancer/servers/0/url=http://fqdn-of-docker-node:8080" \
  -d 11notes/nginx:stable
```

## Parent image
* [11notes/node:stable](https://github.com/11notes/docker-node)

## Built with and thanks to
* [npm::redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis)
* [npm::dockerode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerode)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org)

## Tips
* Only use rootless container runtime (podman, rootless docker)
* Don't bind to ports < 1024 (requires root), use NAT/reverse proxy (haproxy, traefik, nginx)
* Do not access docker.sock as root
